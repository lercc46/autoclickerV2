# summary
Hey there, this is a simple autoclicker I put together using python and the customtkinter GUI module. It's a "V2" because the clicker code came from a tutorial and originally I just copied that directly and added some terminal input. I created this because my little brother plays lots of Roblox games that he wants an autoclicker for and regularly visits super sketchy websites to try to find one, so I just wrote him one myself. He still uses the original version that I made because I can't figure out how to make a customtkinter-based file work with pyinstaller (a python to .exe converter module).

# contents
This repo contains the autoclicker independent source code ("autoclickerV2.py") as well as two testing files for the clicker itself ("clicker_testing.py") and for customtkinter ("ctk_testing.py").
